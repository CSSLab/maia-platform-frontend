/**
 * Classification criteria documentation:
 *
 * 1. BLUNDER (??): More than 10% Stockfish winrate loss compared to best move
 * 2. INACCURACY (?!): More than 5% Stockfish winrate loss compared to best move
 * 3. EXCELLENT (!!): At least 10% higher Stockfish winrate than weighted average AND less than 10% Maia probability
 *
 * Note: Blunder and inaccuracy winrate loss comparisons are against the BEST POSSIBLE MOVE.
 * Excellent moves are compared against the weighted average winrate (using Maia probabilities as weights).
