# Maia Platform v1.0: From Beta to Launch

Today marks a milestone in human-centered chess AI as we officially launch **Maia Platform v1.0**. This isn't just an update—it's a complete transformation that represents months of development, research, and community feedback since our beta release. The v1 launch introduces groundbreaking features that fundamentally change how players interact with chess AI, making human-like analysis more accessible and insightful than ever before.

## The Heart of v1: Maia 2 Model

At the core of our v1 launch is the revolutionary **Maia 2 model**, which now powers every page and feature across the platform. This isn't simply an incremental improvement—it's a complete reimagining of what human-like chess AI can achieve.

**What makes Maia 2 special?** Unlike traditional engines that focus on finding the "best" move, Maia 2 provides truly human-like analytics and insights. The model understands not just what moves are good, but what moves humans of different skill levels are likely to make and why. This human-centric approach is seamlessly integrated with Stockfish analysis, creating a comprehensive analytical framework that offers both the objectivity of perfect play and the subjectivity of human decision-making.

**The Stockfish Integration:** Maia 2 works in harmony with Stockfish to deliver more comprehensive analysis than either engine could provide alone. While Stockfish shows you the objectively best moves, Maia 2 explains what real players would actually do in the position, creating a unique dual perspective that helps players understand both perfect play and human psychology.

This integration appears throughout the platform—from move predictions and probability assessments to the new analysis components we'll explore below. The result is analysis that feels intuitive and educational, bridging the gap between computer perfection and human understanding.

## Revolutionary Analysis Page

The analysis page has been completely transformed with powerful new components that make game analysis more intuitive and comprehensive than ever before.

### Moves by Rating Component

Our new **Moves by Rating component** provides an interactive scatter plot that shows how move preferences change across different skill levels. Each point represents a possible move, with the x-axis showing the move's engine evaluation and the y-axis showing how likely players of different ratings are to play it. This visualization immediately reveals which moves are "human-like" versus "computer-like," helping players understand the gap between optimal play and practical play.

### Interactive MoveMap

The **MoveMap** feature transforms how you explore game variations. Instead of linear move lists, you can now visualize the branching tree of possible moves, with each branch showing Maia's predictions for how likely players are to continue down that path. This makes it easy to explore not just what happened in the game, but what could have happened based on human playing patterns.

### Blunder Meter

Perhaps our most innovative new feature is the **Blunder Meter**, which provides real-time predictions of whether a player is likely to make a good move, an okay move, or a blunder in any given position. Using Maia 2's understanding of human psychology, the meter shows percentage predictions (e.g., "65% chance of a good move, 25% okay, 10% blunder") that update as the game progresses. This helps players understand not just what happened, but the psychological pressure and decision-making context behind each move.

### Advanced Highlighting System

The new highlight component intelligently draws attention to critical moments in games. Rather than simply highlighting blunders, it identifies "human moments"—positions where the psychological pressure was high, where most players would struggle, or where the actual move reveals something interesting about human decision-making patterns.

### Custom Analysis Tools

v1 introduces powerful new capabilities for custom analysis:

- **FEN/PGN Loading**: Import any position or game for analysis with full Maia 2 and Stockfish integration
- **Free Play Mode**: Set up any position and make variations from actual games to test different moves and explore alternative lines
- **Variation Exploration**: Dive deep into "what if" scenarios with Maia's help, seeing how different human-like responses would play out in any position

These tools make the analysis page a comprehensive workspace for understanding chess at both the tactical and psychological levels.

## Opening Drill Page: Master Your Repertoire

The new **Opening Drill Page** transforms how players learn and practice openings. Rather than passive study, it provides an interactive, structured approach to building opening knowledge.

### Configuration and Setup

Starting a drill session is intuitive:
1. **Choose Your Openings**: Browse our comprehensive opening book and select multiple openings you want to practice
2. **Configure Your Practice**: Pick specific variations within your chosen openings to focus your training
3. **Set Drill Parameters**: Choose the number of drills you want to complete and your preferred practice settings
4. **Begin Post-Opening Practice**: The system randomly selects positions from your chosen openings, starting you in the post-opening phase where you practice the critical moves that happen after the opening theory ends

### Interactive Practice

During practice, the system guides you through each critical position:
- **Move Prompts**: The system presents positions and asks you to find the repertoire move
- **Immediate Feedback**: Correct moves advance the drill; incorrect moves provide explanation and correction
- **Contextual Learning**: Each position includes explanations of why the move is important and what it accomplishes
- **Variation Exploration**: Encounter common deviations and learn how to respond

### Performance Analysis

After each drill session, you receive comprehensive feedback that goes far beyond simple accuracy metrics:
- **Stockfish Evaluation Over Time**: See how the engine evaluation changed throughout your post-opening play
- **Maia Rating Analysis**: Discover what rating level your moves resembled during the drill
- **Important Moments**: Identify critical positions and key decision points in the post-opening phase you practiced
- **Move Quality Assessment**: Detailed analysis of your strongest and weakest moves in each position
- **Overall Performance Summary**: After completing all your selected drills, view comprehensive statistics across all openings practiced

This systematic approach ensures that opening study becomes active, measurable, and directly applicable to your games.

## Enhanced Puzzle and Bot-or-Not Features

Both our puzzle training and Bot-or-Not challenge modes have received significant upgrades that make them more educational and engaging.

### Puzzle Analysis and Review

Completing a puzzle is now just the beginning:
- **Post-Puzzle Analysis**: After solving (or failing to solve) a puzzle, dive deep into the position with full Maia 2 analysis
- **Position Exploration**: Make moves and explore the position freely with all the same analysis tools available on the main analysis page
- **Alternative Solutions**: Explore other candidate moves and understand why they don't work
- **Historical Access**: Access your complete puzzle history with the ability to revisit and re-analyze any previous puzzle
- **Rating Tracking**: Monitor your puzzle rating changes over time with detailed performance metrics

### Bot-or-Not Enhancements

The Bot-or-Not challenge has evolved into a sophisticated training tool:
- **Detailed Analysis**: After each challenge, review the actual game with explanations of which moves were "human-like" vs. "computer-like"
- **Learning Mode**: Understand the tells that distinguish human play from engine play
- **Rating System**: Track your ability to distinguish human from AI play with a specialized rating
- **Historical Challenges**: Access and revisit your complete challenge history to understand your improvement in detecting AI play over time

### Progress Tracking

Both modes now include comprehensive progress tracking:
